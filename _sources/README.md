Homework #4
By: Group 16

All code and data is based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository. This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the Spring 2023 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science. Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration. Below is the Binder link to this repository. There is also a JupyterBook link on the right.
